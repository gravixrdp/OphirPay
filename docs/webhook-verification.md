# Webhook Signature Verification

Every webhook delivery OphirPay sends is an HTTP `POST` to your registered
endpoint with an HMAC-SHA256 signature, so you can prove the request really
came from OphirPay and was not tampered with in transit.

```
POST /hooks HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
X-OphirPay-Signature: 83ab64c58dadec406835ebd9b907b579cb89132098823ec66f2b96dd1ad84258
X-OphirPay-Timestamp: 2026-08-14T00:00:00Z
X-OphirPay-Event: payment.created

{
  "event": "payment.created",
  "timestamp": "2026-08-14T00:00:00Z",
  "data": { "id": "p_123", "amount": 100 },
  "signature": "83ab64c58dadec406835ebd9b907b579cb89132098823ec66f2b96dd1ad84258"
}
```

- **`X-OphirPay-Signature`** — HMAC-SHA256 (hex) over
  `<timestamp>.<canonical body>`, the value you must verify.
- **`X-OphirPay-Timestamp`** — the delivery timestamp, ISO 8601 UTC. It is
  **part of the signed material**, so it is authentic: use it for the replay
  freshness window. It mirrors the body's `timestamp` field.
- **`X-OphirPay-Event`** — the event type, mirrored in the body's `event`
  field. Informational; don't trust it for verification.
- **`signature`** (in the body) — the same value as the header, mirrored for
  convenience. Always verify against the **header** value.

---

## The exact canonical form

OphirPay signs the payload with `buildSignedPayload` (see
`src/lib/webhook-deliver.ts`), and the receiver must reproduce the **exact
same byte string** before recomputing the HMAC:

1. **Take the timestamp** — the `X-OphirPay-Timestamp` header value. (When the
   header is absent you may fall back to the body's `timestamp` field, which is
   signed too; the reference verifiers do this.)
2. **Parse** the received body as JSON.
3. **Empty the `signature` field** — set it to `""`. Keep the key; do *not*
   delete it. The canonical string contains `"signature":""` as the last key.
4. **Re-serialize with stable key order** — the order of the keys as received
   (parse-then-stringify preserves insertion order; do not sort or reorder).
5. **Prepend the timestamp and a dot** — the signed input is
   `<timestamp>.<canonical body>`.
6. **HMAC-SHA256** that input with your webhook secret, hex-encoded.
7. **Compare** against `X-OphirPay-Signature` using a constant-time comparison.

Concretely, the signature is computed over this exact string:

```
2026-08-14T00:00:00Z.{"event":"payment.created","timestamp":"2026-08-14T00:00:00Z","data":{"id":"p_123","amount":100},"signature":""}
```

> ℹ️ Because the timestamp appears **both** as the prefix and inside the
> canonical body, the `X-OphirPay-Timestamp` header cannot be edited without
> invalidating the signature. That is what makes the header safe to trust for
> replay protection.

> ⚠️ **The most common bug:** stripping the `signature` field out of the
> object (`const { signature, ...rest } = body`). That removes the key
> entirely and produces a different canonical string than the sender signed.
> **Empty it — don't remove it.**

> ⚠️ **Key order matters.** The canonical string is the JSON with keys in the
> order the sender serialized them (`event`, `timestamp`, `data`, `signature`).
> Parse and re-serialize in the received order; never sort keys or
> pretty-print the JSON.

---

## Replay protection

The signature proves *authenticity* (the body came from OphirPay and wasn't
tampered with). It does **not** by itself prevent *replay* — an attacker can
capture a valid request and re-send it later. Combine two defenses:

### 1. Timestamp freshness window

Every delivery carries an `X-OphirPay-Timestamp` header (ISO 8601 UTC),
mirrored by the body's `timestamp` field. Because the timestamp is part of the
signed material (see above), an attacker cannot refresh a captured delivery by
editing it. Reject deliveries whose timestamp is too old or too far in the
future:

- **Too old** (e.g. older than 5 minutes) — likely a replay of a captured
  request.
- **In the future** (beyond a small clock-skew allowance, e.g. 5 minutes) —
  a sign of a fabricated or manipulated payload.

OphirPay retries failed deliveries up to 3 times (1s, 2s, 4s backoff) with
the **same payload and signature**, so your window must comfortably cover the
retry span — 5 minutes is a sensible default. A fresh delivery has a
timestamp within a second or two of receipt.

### 2. Idempotent processing (dedupe)

Because retries are byte-identical, process each logical event **at most
once**. Keep a short-lived store of recently processed events keyed by
`event + timestamp` (or a hash of the canonical body) and skip duplicates.
This makes replays harmless even if they arrive inside the freshness window.

> Note: the payload carries no monotonic delivery ID today. Use the `data.id`
> of the underlying record when it is stable, or hash the canonical body — it
> is stable across retries and unique per logical event.

## Reference implementations

Runnable, dependency-free examples are in
[`examples/webhook-verification/`](../examples/webhook-verification/):

| Language | File | Run |
|---|---|---|
| Node.js (ESM) | [`node/verify.mjs`](../examples/webhook-verification/node/verify.mjs) | `node verify.mjs --secret <secret> --signature <hex> --body-file body.json` |
| Python 3 | [`python/verify.py`](../examples/webhook-verification/python/verify.py) | `python3 verify.py --secret <secret> --signature <hex> --body-file body.json` |
| Go | [`go/verify.go`](../examples/webhook-verification/go/verify.go) | `go run verify.go --secret <secret> --signature <hex> --body-file body.json` |

Both print `VALID` (exit 0) or `INVALID: <reason>` (exit 1), and both
implement the canonical form above plus a configurable freshness window
(`--max-age`, default 300s; `--max-age 0` disables it).

### Sample payload (self-test)

```json
{
  "event": "payment.created",
  "timestamp": "2026-08-14T00:00:00Z",
  "data": { "id": "p_123", "amount": 100 },
  "signature": "83ab64c58dadec406835ebd9b907b579cb89132098823ec66f2b96dd1ad84258"
}
```

- **Secret:** `test-secret-0123456789`
- **Timestamp header:** `2026-08-14T00:00:00Z`
- **Canonical body:** `{"event":"payment.created","timestamp":"2026-08-14T00:00:00Z","data":{"id":"p_123","amount":100},"signature":""}`
- **Signed input:** `2026-08-14T00:00:00Z.{"event":"payment.created","timestamp":"2026-08-14T00:00:00Z","data":{"id":"p_123","amount":100},"signature":""}`

Verify your own implementation reproduces `83ab64c58dadec406835ebd9b907b579cb89132098823ec66f2b96dd1ad84258`
over that signed input. The sample's timestamp is fixed, so pass `--now`
when testing (see the examples README).

## Node.js (reference)

```javascript
import { createHmac, timingSafeEqual } from "node:crypto";

/**
 * Verify an OphirPay webhook delivery.
 * @param {string} body      - raw request body (string)

 * @param {string} [timestamp] - X-OphirPay-Timestamp header value
 * @param {number} maxAgeSeconds - replay window (0 disables); default 300
 */
export function verifyWebhookSignature({ body, signature, secret, timestamp, maxAgeSeconds = 300 }) {
  // 1–3. Parse, empty the signature field, re-serialize in key order.
  const parsed = JSON.parse(body);
  if (typeof parsed !== "object" || parsed === null || Array.isArray(parsed)) {
    throw new Error("body must be a JSON object");
  }
  const canonical = JSON.stringify({ ...parsed, signature: "" });

  // 4. Recompute the expected HMAC-SHA256 hex over `<timestamp>.<canonical>`.
  const signedTimestamp = String(timestamp ?? parsed.timestamp ?? "");
  const expected = createHmac("sha256", secret)
    .update(`${signedTimestamp}.${canonical}`)
    .digest("hex");

  // 5. Constant-time comparison against the header value.
  const provided = Buffer.from(String(signature ?? ""));
  const expectedBuf = Buffer.from(expected);
  const matches =
    provided.length === expectedBuf.length && timingSafeEqual(provided, expectedBuf);
  if (!matches) return false;

  // Replay protection: timestamp freshness window.
  if (maxAgeSeconds > 0) {
    const ts = Date.parse(signedTimestamp);
    if (Number.isNaN(ts)) return false;
    const ageSeconds = (Date.now() - ts) / 1000;
    if (ageSeconds > maxAgeSeconds || ageSeconds < -maxAgeSeconds) return false;
  }
  return true;
}
```

Example usage in a route handler:

```javascript
// Express-style example
app.post("/webhooks/ophirpay", (req, res) => {
  const signature = req.headers["x-ophirpay-signature"];
  const timestamp = req.headers["x-ophirpay-timestamp"];
  const valid = verifyWebhookSignature({
    body: JSON.stringify(req.body),
    signature,
    timestamp,
    secret: process.env.WEBHOOK_SECRET,
  });
  if (!valid) return res.status(401).end();
  res.status(200).end(); // acknowledge quickly, then process
});
```

## Verification checklist

- [ ] Compare against the `X-OphirPay-Signature` **header**, not the body field.
- [ ] Sign/verify `<X-OphirPay-Timestamp>.<canonical body>` — the timestamp
      is part of the signed input.
- [ ] Empty the `signature` field — **don't delete the key**.
- [ ] Re-serialize with the received key order — no sorting, no pretty-print.
- [ ] Use a **constant-time** comparison (`timingSafeEqual` /
      `hmac.compare_digest`).
- [ ] Enforce a timestamp freshness window on the signed timestamp (default
      300s).
- [ ] Process events **idempotently** (dedupe by `event + timestamp`).
- [ ] Return a `2xx` quickly after verification; do heavy work async.
- [ ] Rotate the secret and re-verify on `401` — a mismatch means the
      delivery is not from OphirPay or was modified in transit.

## Delivery target policy (SSRF guard)

OphirPay makes outbound `POST` requests to the URL you register, so the server
refuses any target that could be used to reach its own network. A rejected
target fails the delivery with a clear error —
`"Webhook target rejected by the SSRF guard — URL resolves to a private/internal
address or a disallowed port"` — rather than silently retrying.

**Allowed:** `http` and `https` URLs on **port 80 or 443** (the scheme default
when no port is given). Operators can extend the set with the comma-separated
`WEBHOOK_ALLOWED_PORTS` environment variable (e.g. `WEBHOOK_ALLOWED_PORTS=80,443,8443`);
anything not listed is rejected.

**Blocked regardless of port:**

| Category | Examples |
|---|---|
| Loopback | `127.0.0.0/8`, `::1` |
| Private IPv4 | `10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`, `192.168.0.0/16` |
| Link-local (cloud metadata) | `169.254.0.0/16`, `fe80::/10` |
| Carrier-grade NAT | `100.64.0.0/10` |
| Documentation / benchmarking / multicast / reserved | `192.0.2.0/24`, `198.51.100.0/24`, `203.0.113.0/24`, `198.18.0.0/15`, `224.0.0.0/4`, `240.0.0.0/4` |
| IPv6 ULA / multicast | `fc00::/7`, `ff00::/8` |
| IPv4-mapped/compatible IPv6 whose embedded IPv4 is private | `::ffff:127.0.0.1`, `::ffff:10.0.0.1` |
| Internal hostnames | `localhost`, `*.localhost`, `*.local`, `*.internal`, `*.lan`, `*.home.arpa`, `metadata.google.internal` |
| Embedded credentials | `https://user:pass@host/hook` |

**DNS rebinding:** the host is re-resolved and re-validated immediately before
**every** delivery attempt, not once at registration. If a hostname resolves
publicly when you register it but privately later, that attempt is refused.
